# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My main VCS is now at my nerdy self-hosted Gitea instance [git.randomplace.online](https://git.randomplace.online/yevi.org):

## [HA Client](https://git.randomplace.online/yevi.org/ha_client)
My greatest spare-time creature. The first Home Assistant fully native Android client from the times when there were no official alternatives.
## [ha_client_fcf](https://git.randomplace.online/yehor/ha_client_fcf)
Firebase Cloud Functions for HA Client app
## [VaporizR2](https://git.randomplace.online/yevi.org/VaporizR2)
An Android remote control for a custom Arduino-based Bluetooth RC car
## [XiaomiAntsAlarmService](https://git.randomplace.online/yevi.org/XiaomiAntsAlarmService)
The first somehow useful app I wrote for an Android. It was so long ago, that I don't even remember what it does.
